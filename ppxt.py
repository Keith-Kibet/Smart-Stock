# Slide 3: Introduction
add_slide("Introduction",
          "The Stock Brokerage Management System is designed to optimize stock trading through "
          "machine learning and real-time data processing. It leverages LSTM and CNN models for "
          "stock price prediction, sentiment analysis for market trends, and risk assessment tools "
          "for better investment decisions.")

# Slide 4: Literature Review
add_slide("Literature Review",
          "Stock trading has evolved from manual to algorithmic trading and now AI-driven strategies. "
          "Machine learning models such as LSTM and CNN improve stock price forecasting and risk assessment. "
          "Sentiment analysis provides insights into market trends and trader behavior.")

# Slide 5: Problem Statement
add_slide("Problem Statement",
          "Traditional stock trading systems lack real-time data processing, efficient risk management, "
          "and adaptability to market changes. Many predictive models rely solely on historical data, "
          "resulting in delayed decision-making and increased financial risks.")

# Slide 6: Justification
add_slide("Justification",
          "The stock market is highly volatile, requiring traders to make informed decisions quickly. "
          "Traditional systems do not integrate real-time market sentiment and financial indicators effectively. "
          "This system leverages machine learning to improve accuracy, risk management, and adaptability.")

# Slide 7: Objectives
add_slide("Objectives",
          "Main Objective: Develop a Machine Learning-Driven Stock Trading Optimization System that integrates "
          "real-time stock data, predictive analytics, and risk assessment tools.\n\n"
          "Specific Objectives:\n"
          "- Provide real-time stock data for informed decisions.\n"
          "- Implement machine learning models (LSTM, CNN) for trend forecasting.\n"
          "- Incorporate risk assessment tools (Sharpe Ratio, Value at Risk).\n"
          "- Analyze sentiment data from news and social media.")

# Slide 8: Methodology
add_slide("Methodology",
          "- Data Collection: Stock data from Yahoo Finance and Finviz, sentiment data from news and social media.\n"
          "- Machine Learning Models: LSTM and CNN for stock prediction, NLP for sentiment analysis.\n"
          "- System Design: Python backend, Streamlit frontend, SQL database for authentication.\n"
          "- Deployment: Cloud-based infrastructure, Docker containers for scalability.\n"
          "- Testing: Unit testing, system testing, and security validation.")
